## Our Projects

- **[Central Hub](link-to-project)**: Central Hub is our key project, designed as a comprehensive guide to our lab's primary goals, strategic roadmaps, and in-depth documentation. It serves as an intuitive navigation system, presenting our collective achievements and future plans while fostering collaboration and clarity.
- **[Synchronous Digital Twin in ROS 2 Video Examples](https://github.com/SmartFactoryLab-UFCG/Digital_Twin_Video_Example)**: This temporary repository displays example videos of our latest project, Synchronous Digital Twin using ROS 2.
<!-- - **[UR10 Digital Twin](link-to-project)**: The UR10 Digital Twin project is focused on creating a precise virtual replica of the UR10 manipulator, used in our Smart Factory Laboratory. This digital twin integrates with ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), enhancing the precision and efficiency of simulations and real-time performance analysis, using 5G communication.
- **[Omni Bot](link-to-project)**: The Omni Bot project focuses on designing, manufacturing, and controlling an advanced omnidirectional robot, leveraging ROS 2 integration. It's strategically crafted for diverse applications within a smart factory, enhancing operational efficiency and handling complex tasks with precision.
- **[Pegasus Control](link-to-project)**: The Pegasus Control project focuses on adapting the Pegasus Amatrol manipulator controller for integration with ROS 2, fostering increased productivity and precision within our Smart Factory while optimizing costs and processes.
- **[Online Hand Eye Calibration for UR10](link-to-project)**: This project is aimed at generating a synthetic image database of the UR10 manipulator, and use NVIDIA's DREAM project to train a neural network for real-time hand-eye calibration, enhancing precision and operational efficiency. -->
